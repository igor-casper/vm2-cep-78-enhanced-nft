> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress. The code, APIs, and tooling may change at any time without notice.

This project is under active development, with some features still in progress. Specifically, metadata validation and owner-reverse-lookup-mode are not yet implemented. Despite these gaps, this implementation offers valuable insights into the potential structure of VM2 contracts and areas within the VM that may require improvement.
